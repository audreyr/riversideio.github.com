It's an awesome environment to be in whether you're hacking on a weekend project, or coming in after work to get some stuff done. I'm so excited for the upcoming year, and to be a part of all the greatness that's to come!"

Thanks to it, I've signed several website contracts, made a lot of talented friends, listened to Scott Motte's crazy pop music blazing in the background, and found a hot girl and got engaged to be married. If you come stop by, you WILL find yourself a girl (or guy) and save a LOT on car insurance too. Gosh o MIGHTY. I love Riverside.IO so much that I can barely walk. Barely BREATHE. I need someone to walk across the street with sometimes or I'll fall down. I love it so much that I think I'll have my wedding here. Maybe I'll name my first kid Riverside.IO. You should too."
